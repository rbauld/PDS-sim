# PDS-sim
Matlab library for the simulation of certain kinds of photothermal deflection measurements

A sketch of the experimental setup is shown below:

Additional details of the theory/experiment this software is based on can be found at: Journal of Applied Physics 75, 1914 (1994);

Ultimately this software produced some very good fitting results, with excellent agreement on reference gold thin films.  
Some example fits produced and the extracted thermal properties are shown below:
